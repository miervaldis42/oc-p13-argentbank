This project is the 13th project of OpenClassrooms JavaScript - React Developer Program.\
The objective is using React, Redux & API calls to build the frontend of a legacy project.

## 🧑‍💻 Stack

Here is the stack used in the project :

🌅 Front-end:

- [React](https://react.dev/)

## 🚀 Run the Project

To run the project :

1. Use `npm run start-dev` or `npm run start` in a terminal linked to the project root folder
2. After running the previous commands, the following will happen :

   - Dependencies at the root of the project, in the frontend and backend will be installed
   - React will open the website in the browser at `http://localhost:3000`
   - Node server will be running at `http://localhost:3001`
   - Swagger documentation can be seen at `http://localhost:3001/api-docs/`

3. In another terminal _(linked to the root project too)_, type `npm run database-setup` to populate the database with [some users](./server/README.md)
